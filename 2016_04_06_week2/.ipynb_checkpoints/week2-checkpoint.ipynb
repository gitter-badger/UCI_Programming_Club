      "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\n",
      "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\n",
      "    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n",
      "As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n",
      "“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\n",
      "            Only this and nothing more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\n",
      "And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n",
      "    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n",
      "    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\n",
      "For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n",
      "            Nameless here for evermore.\n",
      "\n",
      "    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n",
      "Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n",
      "    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n",
      "    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n",
      "Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n",
      "            This it is and nothing more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n",
      "“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n",
      "    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n",
      "    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n",
      "That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\n",
      "            Darkness there and nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n",
      "Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n",
      "    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n",
      "    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\n",
      "This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\n",
      "            Merely this and nothing more.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n",
      "Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n",
      "    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n",
      "      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\n",
      "Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n",

      "In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n",
      "    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n",
      "    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n",
      "Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n",
      "            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n",

      "    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n",

      "            With such name as “Nevermore.”\n",

      "    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n",
      "That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n",
      "    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n",
      "    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n",
      "On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\n",
      "            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n",
      "“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n",
      "    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n",
      "    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n",
      "Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n",
      "            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\n",
      "Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n",
      "    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n",
      "    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n",
      "What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n",
      "            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n",
      "\n",
      "    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n",
